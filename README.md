This tasks focuses on core Java concepts and best practices. It showcases how to handle exceptions (including a custom NotEnoughMoneyException), use try-with-resources for safe file operations, manipulate strings by replacing characters, and even fetch external data over HTTP.

***This repository contains several small Java programs illustrating various fundamental Java concepts:***

✔️ NullPointerException – how to intentionally throw it and handle it in a try/catch block.

✔️ Account with Custom Exception – demonstrating a custom NotEnoughMoneyException for an Account class.

✔️ File Copy (space to dash replacement) – using try-with-resources to copy a text file while transforming spaces into dashes.

✔️ Bank Prefix Lookup – reading an external file (NBP data) from the internet and finding a bank name based on the user’s account prefix.
